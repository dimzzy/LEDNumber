LEDNumberLayer is a CALayer that has the 'number' property and draws it as if it was composed from LED indicators. The property is animatable:

	CABasicAnimation *dna = [CABasicAnimation animationWithKeyPath:@"number"];
	dna.fromValue = [NSNumber numberWithInt:0];
	dna.toValue = [NSNumber numberWithInt:218];
	dna.duration = 5;
	dna.fillMode = kCAFillModeRemoved;
	[self.dnView.numberLayer addAnimation:dna forKey:@"numberFlip"];
	self.dnView.numberLayer.number = 218;

LEDNumberView is a simple wrapper view for LEDNumberLayer.
